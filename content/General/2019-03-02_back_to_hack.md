It has now been 5 years since my last post. A lot has changed since then.

I met a girl, got a dog, bought a house in Antibes (south-east of France), left Ignilife one year ago (after 4 years of good and loyal services) and started working remotely for Nextmotion, a start-up located in Paris which provides services for doctors in aesthetics.

Working remotely has many advantages, the main one being to avoid traffic jam and get two more free hours every day. I use this time as well as evenings and week-ends to do some work as a freelance and try to keep up with the incredible number of new technologies that get released.

During the last years, I got a lot of expertise with the Python language and the Django framework, managing tech teams, CI/CD, GDPR and health-related security, handling production environments and many more things.

What now? I have a large list of technologies which I want to **learn**, pending projects to finish and ideas for new projets to start. I also have not contributed enough to the **open source** community lately: I will release as much code as I can in the coming months and contribute to existing projects. I also want to participate in **coding competitions** and **coding events**, **meet passionate coders** and **share knowledge**.
