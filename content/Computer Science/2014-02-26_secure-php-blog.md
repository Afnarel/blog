I have begun cleaning up my GitHub account. I have removed some useless
projects and am currently working on documenting and tidying up the projects
I find interesting.

So this is the first one. It is a project that I did during my studies at
Polytech Nice Sophia. The goal was to write a secure web application in PHP.
I will not say much more here, but you can read the README on the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Afnarel/Secure-PHP-Blog) of the project.
