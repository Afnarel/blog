At the beginning of the month (3rd of March), I have joined
[Ignilife](http://www.ignilife.com) as a Python (Django) back-end developer.

Ignilife is a start-up founded by Fabrice PAKIN (CEO) and David BESSOUDO (CTO)
whose aim is to help people have a better control over their health and
well-being. [It has been selected by Europe4Startups](http://www.itnation.lu/start-up-2/e-health-startup-ignilife/30199/) as a promising start-up.

It focuses on prevention and acts in different domains:

  * Physical health
  * Emotional health (stress...)
  * Nutrition
  * ...

To provide serious scientifically-approved advices, Ignilife has partnerships
with physicians who are specialists in those fields.

The solution we develop is a cloud platform which can be accessed through a
web app and a mobile app. Users of the platform can follow programs designed
by doctors and adapted to their needs. For instance, a person that does not
practice any sport at all will be encouraged to perform simple exercises while
someone who trains on a daily basis will be provided with more advanced ones.
Also, a person who hasn't been taking care of the food she ate until now but
feels the need to improve her diet will have access to simple advices to get
started while someone who is already counting calories and stuff will be
provided with deeper suggestions.

The social dimension will let users of the community give tips of their own
and encourage each other.

I won't say more just now: you will see for yourself when the time is right ;)

I love this new job which is both intellectually and ethically fulfilling.
I hope you will soon hear of us in the media. Digital health-care is coming!
